- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Becky Hall
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data visualizations, coding, statistics, and agriculture. My passion for data and analytics resides at the intersection of technical knowledge and the opportunity to teach others how to use data to make informed decisions. I've spent the last eight years working in the agriculture industry, providing value-adding insights to my teams. While the work I currently do is owned by my employer, I have included links to projects and scripts I completed in while getting a Masters Degree in Business Analytics and an MBA at the University of Iowa.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python as well as continuing to improve my coding skills. Writing and reading SQL, R, and Python scripts is akin to learning a foreign language, so I actievly engage in refresh courses offered through Coursera.

Some of my previous work includes:
- Creating an interactive Tableau Dashboard for the Polk County Health Department to use and pull Census data for grant writing and ad-hock reports. I cold-called 15 local organizations prior to the start of my capstone class to gather information on data needs in my community. I ultimatly settled on the Polk County Health Department (PHCD) as they served as a centralized location for data nonprofits used for grant writing. 
- The PCHD requested a way to quickly pull and visualize Census data. The raw data existed in zipped files on the Census Bureau's website and offered little insight on how to combine data files and decode the metadata.
