- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Becky Hall! I work as a Data Catalyst at John Deere.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in developing data visualizations, writing code, and conducting statistical analysis. My technical background in data science partnered with my passion for teaching and public speaking has provided me with unique opportunities to educate various individuals on the power of data and the importance of analytics in making informed business decisions. I've spent the last eight years working in the agriculture industry, providing value-adding insights to my colleagues. While the work I currently do is owned by my employer, I included links to projects, analysis, and scripts I wrote while getting a Masters Degree in Business Analytics and an MBA at the University of Iowa.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python as well as continuing to improve my coding skills. Writing and reading SQL, R, and Python scripts is akin to speaking a foreign language, so I actively engage in refresh courses offered through Coursera to remain fluent.

Some of my previous work includes:

- Creating an interactive Tableau Dashboard for the Polk County Health Department to use and pull Census data for grant writing and ad-hoc reports. 
- I cold-called 15 local organizations prior to the start of my capstone class to gather information on data needs in my community. I ultimately settled on the Polk County Health Department (PHCD) as they served as a centralized location for data used by non profits for grant writing.
  - The PCHD requested a way to quickly pull and visualize Census data. The raw data existed in zipped files on the Census Bureau's website and offered little insight on how to combine data files and decode the metadata.
  **- My specific role in the project**: Facilitating all touch base meetings with the PCHD, ensuring customer needs were captured and met, creating the Tableau Workbook, and creating/editing the final presentation.

- Developing a model to predict whether a specifically sized pixel block in a given image contained human skin or not skin, excluding the border pixels on an image. This type of model development serves as the foundation for facial recognition software. The paper analyzes the results of KNN, LVQ, and Ensembling models on the testing and production datasets.
  **- My specific role in the project:** Built all the visualizations, assisted with model development and code, wrote/edited the final paper, and put together the final presentation

- Creating a data warehouse, writing the data into the database, analyzing the dataset, building a website, and developing visuals.
  - I used data detailing liquor sales from distributors to stores that held a Class E Liquor License between June 2019 and June 2020 in the city of Waukee, Iowa.    The overall trends in data suggest stores starting purchasing additional liquor inventory from suppliers when Covid-19 started to significantly affect Iowa, and the temporary legislation that allowed restaurants and bars to sell alcohol to go negatively impacted the amount of orders placed by some stores.
